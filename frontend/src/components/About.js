            <h2>About the creator</h2>
            <p> After years of falling in love with journaling and Web Development. 
            I decided to put my two loves together in an easy to use, completely customizable digital journal. 
            Once my family grew bigger and life got busy, I needed a way of keeping track of everything. 
            After searching for everything I needed, I found that I had loads of Apps and not one fit all of my needs.
            Then Tracker was born. One place for all my needs in one simple place. No more lugging around multiple journals 
            or dozens of apps that go unused on my phone.</p>
